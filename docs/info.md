## How it works

Implemented is a full adder that uses inputs from the user and performs the correct logic to output the sum on LED's. When adding bits the sum LED (S) will light up when only one of the switches are high. If two switches are high the carry out LED (Cout) will be lit. If all three switches are high, then both the sum and carry out LED's will light up.

## How to test

To test, flip any switches one through three and observe the output.

## External hardware

Used in this project is and 8-bit dip switch, 5 LED's, 2 XOR gates, 2 AND gates, and 1 OR gate.
